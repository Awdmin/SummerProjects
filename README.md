# SummerProjects

This repository contains a collection of small projects I've built while learning and experimenting with various programming concepts, tools, and technologies.

## 📁 Projects

Each folder in this repo is a standalone project with its own purpose. Some are complete, some are just experiments.

## 💡 Purpose

- Practice programming
- Try out new libraries or frameworks
- Learn by doing

## 🧰 Tech Stack

Projects may include:
- MongoDB
- Go
- React
- Anything else I’m exploring

## 📌 Notes

These projects are meant for learning — not production. Expect some rough edges!
